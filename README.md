EmulateContacts
===============

While working with contacts backup application on windows phones, there will be a scenario when you will have to emulate a large number of contacts to test the application. EmulateContacts is an application that you can use to add contacts to your address book and test your application for various contact loads.

This application asks the user to enter any number of contacts that needs to be created and generates the contacts in the address book. An Image is added to each contact as well. 

This is a really simple application, but it can be tweaked to make it a full fledged app. 

Note: Windows phone ecosystem restricts the access of contacts to the containing application. What this means is that, if you want to use this code, you will have to plug in the code from this sample projet to your application and generate the contacts. The reason is because of the contact store creation and updation.
